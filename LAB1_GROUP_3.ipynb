    "#11) Please explain the following terms:\n",
    "#o Cryptography: \n",
    "        ## Cryptography is the practice of protecting communication and information so that individuals who are authorized to access it can read it. \n",
    "        ##This is done by converting it into an unreadable format in which individuals who intended can read and process it. \n",
    "        ##There are many techniques and algorithms to protect this information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals. \n",
    "#o Encryption: \n",
    "        ##Encryption is a way in cryptography that converts plain text which is unencrypted into cipher text which is encrypted. \n",
    "        ##This is done by using an encryption algorithm and a key. \n",
    "        ##There are massive amount oof sensitive data that are stored online and there where encryption comes in place. \n",
    "        ##Encryption is a process that jumbles up the original message, making it impossible to understand without the right key to unscramble it.\n",
    "#o Plain Text: \n",
    "        ##Plain text is the original, unencrypted message or data. It is the readable and understandable formate that is typically in human-readable language. \n",
    "        ##So, it is technically the text that we use every day. It's the kind of reading a regular book or a message that hasn't been encoded or encrypted.\n",
    "#o Cipher Text:\n",
    "        ##Cipher text is the encrypted message or data that went through the encryption process. It is the way of scrambling or encrypting plain text into a format that is difficult to understand without the proper decryption key. \n",
    "        ##So this is technically like a secret code. Cipher text appears as random of sequence numbers. \n",
    "#o Decryption:\n",
    "        ##Decryption is the process of undoing encryption. Which we are converting cipher text back into plain text using a decryption algorithm and the correct decryption key. \n",
    "        ##This is the reverse way of encryption as described above. \n",
    "#o Double Strength Encryption:\n",
    "        ##Double strength encryption is like adding an extra layer of protection to the secret message. It's similar to using two locks instead of one to secure a valuable item. \n",
    "        ##In this case, encryption is applied twice to the same data or message using different methods or keys.  \n",
    "        ##This makes it very hard for unauthorized people to decrypt.  \n",
    "        ##Having an extra layer of security that provides an additional level of complexity is a great way to make sure it is hard for someone to crack or decrypt. \n",
    "#o Hybrid Encryption:\n",
    "        ##Hybrid encryption is like using a combination of two different locks to keep a secret message safe. It combines symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques. \n",
    "        ##In this encryption, a symmetric key, which is random generated is used to encrypt the actual message. \n",
    "        ##Why we use this is because this males the encryption process fast and efficient for large amounts of data. \n",
    "        ##Next, the symmetric key is encrypted using the recipient's public key. On the other hand, this encryption step uses asymmetric encryption. \n",
    "        ##This provides a secure way to transmit the symmetric key without exposing it to potential attacks. \n",
    "        ##After that, the encrypted key and message are being sent to the recipient in which when they receive it, they use their private key to decrypt the symmetric key.\n",
    "        ##As soon as they decrypt the key, they can then decrypt the message and see the original data in a readable format.  "
